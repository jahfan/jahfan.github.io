A single diamond is: (space) /stars\ (space)

Two diamonds would be: (space) /stars\ (space*2) + 1 /stars\ (space)

Three diamonds would be: (space) /stars\ (space*2) + 1 /stars\ (space*2) + 1 /stars\ (space)

// The + 1 added to space*2 is to make the number of spaces odd and end at 1.
// Space*2 b/c every triangle needs to keep the proper spacing to remain a triangle
